# golang-python-comparison

A brief slide deck introducing Go and comparing it to Python

Tried https://marp.app/blog/marp-for-vs-code-v1, but could not get the desired layout with two columns with Markdown. Tried this approach https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/issues/132, but it doesn't give me what I want. It seems to 1. only allow overflowing text to enter the second column, and 2. not allowing one to use Markdown _within_ the HTML tags.

Trying Reveal.js: https://www.evilznet.com/vscode-reveal/#/README
There I got it to work, with this approach: https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md/issues/223#issuecomment-527424283
It enables me to have two columns and have markdown in both.
